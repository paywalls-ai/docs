title: "Shared Mode"
---

Use Shared mode when you want a user‑controlled wallet that works across Paywalls‑enabled apps, minimal setup (built‑in provider available), and automatic revenue split that preserves your margin.

## What it is

- Users authorize your paywall once, top up their shared wallet, and can spend across apps.
- You can use the built‑in provider (powered by OpenRouter) with no keys, or BYOK.
- Charges deduct from the user’s shared wallet; your developer earnings accrue for withdrawal.

## When to use it

- You want the lowest‑friction launch (no provider setup required).
- Your users may use multiple apps; a single wallet improves UX and conversion.
- You’re fine with hosted top‑ups and later withdrawals rather than instant settlement to your Stripe.

## Key behaviors

- Authorization required: the first time a user interacts with your paywall, they’ll be asked to authorize it.
- Assistant messages: if authorization or funding is needed, the proxy returns a normal assistant message containing the correct link—render it as a typical model reply.
- Pricing: per‑model pricing + optional markup is enforced by the proxy; manual charges are also supported.

## Typical flow

1. First chat request (not authorized yet)

- You call POST /chat/completions. If the user isn’t connected, you receive a normal assistant message with an authorization link.
- Show that message verbatim in your UI. After the user authorizes, requests proceed.

2. Insufficient funds

- If balance is low, the assistant message contains a top‑up link (hosted).
- After payment, the next request succeeds automatically.

3. Normal usage

- Requests are metered and charged automatically; responses stream as usual.

## Useful endpoints

- Authorization status and link: [api-reference/user/connect/get.mdx](api-reference/user/connect/get.mdx)
- Top‑up link: [api-reference/user/balance/topup/get.mdx](api-reference/user/balance/topup/get.mdx)
- Manual one‑off charges: [api-reference/user/charge/post.mdx](api-reference/user/charge/post.mdx)
- User menu (links for UI): [api-reference/user/menu/get.mdx](api-reference/user/menu/get.mdx)
- Current balance (for display): [api-reference/user/balance/get.mdx](api-reference/user/balance/get.mdx)

## Minimal example (manual charge + renderable fallback)

```ts
// If success === false, the 'message' field is a renderable assistant message (auth/top‑up link).
const res = await fetch("https://api.paywalls.ai/v1/user/charge", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.PAYWALLS_API_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Idempotency-Key": requestId,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ user, amount: "0.001", metadata: { requestId } }),
});
const json = await res.json();
if (json.success) {
  // proceed
} else {
  // show json.message to the user (no special branching needed)
}
```

## Tips

- Always send a stable, pseudonymous user id (body user or header X‑Paywall‑User).
- Treat assistant messages as normal chat replies—just render them.
- Use idempotency keys for all non‑idempotent POSTs (manual charges, your own side effects).
