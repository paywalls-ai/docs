<Info>
  [FlowXO](https://flowxo.com/) is a **no-code platform** for building and
  automating **AI-powered chatbots**. It enables businesses to deploy
  intelligent bots across websites, WhatsApp, and Messenger that use built-in AI
  to understand user **intent**, detect **entities** (like dates or locations),
  analyze **sentiment**, and connect to **knowledge bases** to provide
  automated, human-like responses for customer support and sales.
</Info>

Integrating FlowXO with Paywalls.ai allows you to **monetize your AI chatbot** on a per-interaction or subscription basis.

Instead of just offering your chatbot for free, this integration places an intelligent "paywall" in front of it. This lets you:

- **Charge Users in Real-Time:** Automatically meter usage and charge for access to your bot's advanced AI features or knowledge bases.
- **Run Dynamic Experiments:** Easily A/B test different pricing models, offer free trials, or reward loyal users with free access, all without recoding your bot.
- **Gate Premium Content:** Use the bot as a gateway, only providing high-value answers, detailed reports, or access to specific functions after a user has paid.

Essentially, it turns your FlowXO chatbot from a free support or engagement tool into a **direct revenue-generating product**.

<Tip>
**To celebrate our partnership with FlowXO, we‚Äôre launching our first AI Hackathon - From Prototype to Profit.** üöÄ

If you think you have what it takes, make sure you participate in the hackathon. Registrations are open, we‚Äôre eager to see what you‚Äôll build with this powerful integration.

## Step 1 - Create your Paywall

<Steps>

<Step title="Sign in">

Sign in to [paywalls.ai dashboard](https://dashboard.paywalls.ai)

</Step>

<Step title="Create Paywall">

<Columns cols={2}>

Click on `Create Paywall` button

![how to create a paywall](/images/use-paywalls-with-flowxo/screenshot-1.png)

</Columns>

</Step>

<Step title="Choose payment provider">

<Columns cols={2}>

<div>

Stripe or Paywalls: Here is where you will receive your payments, if you choose Stripe, payments will be made directly to your Stripe account. To connect stripe you only need to provide the Restricted API Key from your Stripe account.

<br />
<br />
If you don‚Äôt have a Stripe account, you can choose Paywalls, and we will provide
our shared payment method, once users start using your solution, your paywall
balance will increase, and you can withdraw your balance anytime.

</div>

![how to choose payment provider](/images/use-paywalls-with-flowxo/screenshot-2.png)

</Columns>

</Step>

<Step title="Choose your AI Provider">

<Columns cols={2}>

<div>
Choose the LLM you want to connect to (OpenAI, Antrhopic, OpenRouter, TogehterAI, Paywalls, or any other OpenAI compatible LLM like Gemini). This setup is extremely easy, you only need to provide your api key and that‚Äôs all.

<br />
<br />
If you don‚Äôt have an api you can choose Paywalls and we will provide the LLM for
you, instantly getting access to +300 ai models from top-notch providers such as
OpenAI, Antrhopic, Gemini, Deepseek, and more.

</div>

![choosing LLM](/images/use-paywalls-with-flowxo/screenshot-3.png)

</Columns>

</Step>

<Step title="Add your pricing">

<Columns cols={2}>

<div>
You earn by adding a markup on top of the LLM cost. Example: If usage costs \$1 and your markup is 20%, users pay \$1.20. From this, \$1 will go to the LLM provider to cover for the usage and \$0.20 will go directly to your paywalls balance, which you can withdraw anytime.

<br />
<br />
In this setup you can also add trial credits for your users, so they can try your AI solution for free up to a certain usage. For example, if you choose to give \$1 of free trial credits, your users will be able to use your solution for free, until they spend \$1 of AI usage, then they will have to pay.
