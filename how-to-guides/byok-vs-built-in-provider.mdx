title: "BYOK vs Built-in Provider"
---

<Tabs>
	<Tab title="Default mode">
		Connect a **model provider** via BYOK.

    	- **Options:** OpenAI, Together AI (OpenAI‑compatible), OpenRouter (unified OpenAI‑style API), or any OpenAI‑compatible endpoint.

    	- **Billing:** You pay your provider; Paywalls bills your **end users** against their app‑scoped balance.

    	- Paywalls cannot charge a third‑party provider directly from the app‑scoped virtual wallet.

    	- Built-in provider is coming soon for Default mode.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Shared mode">

    	- **Optional:** Use the **built‑in provider (powered by OpenRouter)** to run any supported model with **no setup**. Users pay from their **shared wallet**; Paywalls automatically splits the charge between **developer revenue** and **provider cost** to preserve your configured margin.

    	- **Alternative:** BYOK is also supported. If you need your own models, connect providers you already use (OpenAI, Together, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI‑compatible endpoint). You pay your provider; Paywalls bills your users.
