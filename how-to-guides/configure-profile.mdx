title: "Configure paywall profile (Shared mode)"
---

In Shared mode, each paywall has a public profile shown to users when they authorize your paywall to make charges. The profile displays your paywall name, description, and icon, and is configured in the dashboard.

<Info>
  The paywall profile is only shown in Shared mode during authorization and
  hosted top‑up flows and in the user's activity history. Default mode does not
  expose a public paywall profile.

## Setup

    	Go to Dashboard → Select the paywall you want to configure, then open the Profile section.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set name, description, and icon">

    	- Name: a concise product/app name (human‑readable).

    	- Description: 1–2 sentences describing what users are paying for.

    	- Icon: upload a square image (1:1, e.g., 512×512), PNG or SVG. Use high contrast; it’s shown on light/dark backgrounds.

## Guidelines

- Keep copy short and actionable; avoid jargon.
- Do not include sensitive or misleading claims; ensure you have rights to your brand assets.
- If you support multiple languages in your app, keep the description neutral and easy to understand.

## Where users see it

- Authorization page: when a user connects to your paywall for the first time.
- User's activity history in their wallet.
