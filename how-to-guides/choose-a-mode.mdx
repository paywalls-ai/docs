title: "Choose a mode (Default vs Shared)"
---

Choosing a mode defines how money flows and **can’t be changed later**. Use this decision guide to pick the right setup for your product and team.

### 60‑second decision quickstart

- **Pick Default (App‑scoped)** if you want funds to land in **your Stripe or custom rails**, need tight control over refunds, and can connect your own **model provider** (BYOK).
- **Pick Shared (Cross‑app)** if you want a **built‑in model provider** (powered by OpenRouter) with **no setup**, users to **top up once and spend across apps**, and built‑in **revenue split** that preserves your margin.

### Use this if…

- **Default:** You need direct cash flow to your Stripe, custom pricing per model you contract directly, or B2B control (credits, invoices, refunds) under your policies.
- **Shared:** You want a low‑friction launch, cross‑app user wallets, and automatic provider settlement that preserves your configured margin.

### Avoid if…

- **Default:** You don’t want to manage a provider relationship or payments yourself.
- **Shared:** You need per‑customer invoice workflows under your own merchant account.

### After you choose

- **Default:** Connect a model provider (BYOK) and paste a restricted Stripe key or implement your own rails.

- **Shared:** (Optional) connect your own model provider (BYOK) or use the built‑in provider with no setup.
