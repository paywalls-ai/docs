Use this section to inspect webhook payload schemas for each event type. Each page renders directly from the OpenAPI `webhooks` definition, so it stays in sync with the latest payload contract.

Mintlify automatically embeds the schema, request body fields, and example payload for every webhook below. Return a `2xx` response from your endpoint to confirm delivery.
