## Authentication

All API requests to GetProfile require authentication using your **paywall's API key**.

### How it works

Each paywall in your account has a unique secret API key. This key identifies your paywall and ensures that only you can access and modify your data.

- **Keep your API key secure**
- **Rotate keys in your dashboard if needed**

### Adding the API key to requests

You must include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request to the paywalls.ai API:

```shellscript
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

For example:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.paywalls.ai/v1/models" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Where to find your API key

1. Log in to your Dashboard.
2. Go to Paywalls section
3. Copy the secret APY key for the paywall you want to integrate

<Warning>
  If your API key is compromised, rotate it from the dashboard to protect your data.
</Warning>

### Tips for API key usage

- Never commit your API key to public repositories.
- Use environment variables (process.env.YOUR_API_KEY) in your backend for secure usage.
- Periodically review and rotate keys to maintain security.
