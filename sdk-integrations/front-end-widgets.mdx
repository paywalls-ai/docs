ðŸš§ **Roadmap â€” Frontâ€‘end widgets (in development)**
These will provide dropâ€‘in components and hooks to embed **authorization**, **topâ€‘up**, **balance**, and **activity** in your UI without custom paywall plumbing.

**What they will enable**

- Render paywall assistant messages (auth/topâ€‘up) as native UI and handle link flows automatically.
- Show **BalanceBadge**, **AuthorizeButton**, **TopupButton**, and an **ActivityFeed** with minimal wiring.
- Expose hooks like `usePaywall`, `useBalance`, `useAuthorization` plus a context provider.
- Handle postâ€‘checkout reconciliation (auto refresh/poll), loading/error states, and accessibility.
- Support **theming** and **i18n**; work with CSR/SSR.
- Keep your **paywall key serverâ€‘side** (widgets never require exposing it).

**Status:** Not yet available; actively in development.
