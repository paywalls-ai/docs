A simplified, hosted chat UI wired to your paywall. It lets you try things out without building your own app or UI. The Playground provides a basic chat interface, a **model selector**, and it **automatically handles authorization, top‑ups, and streaming responses**.

**Why it’s useful**

- Quickly validate pricing rules, limits, and balance behavior.
- Test BYOK vs built‑in provider routing with a model picker.
- Share with teammates/testers to gather feedback before wiring your own UI.

**How to access**

- Open your paywall in the dashboard and click **Playground**.
- Use the **unique shareable URL** to invite testers or users.
