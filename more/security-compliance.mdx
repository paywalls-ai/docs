title: "Security & Compliance"

- Keep your **paywall key** server‑side; rotate if compromised.
- Prefer **pseudonymous** `user` IDs; avoid PII.
- Payments via Stripe/crypto handle PCI within their flows; your app must comply with its own ToS/privacy/tax obligations.
- **Data retention & audit — TODO:** retention periods, access controls, exports, regional hosting.
