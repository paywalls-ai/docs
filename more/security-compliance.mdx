This page summarizes how Paywalls handles authentication, data, and payments, and what you should do to keep your integration secure.

## Authentication & key management

- Keep your paywall API key server‑side only (server, edge function, or backend‑for‑frontend).
- Use environment variables or a secret manager; never hard‑code secrets in code or frontends.
- Rotate keys if you suspect exposure; remove old keys and redeploy.
- Prefer restricted provider keys (e.g., Stripe Restricted Key) with the least scopes needed.
- Use `Idempotency-Key` for non‑idempotent POSTs (e.g., manual charges, deposits) to prevent duplicates.

## Data handling & privacy

- Pseudonymous users: prefer stable, pseudonymous `user` IDs; avoid sending PII where not required.
- Data minimization: do not include secrets or PII in prompts, system instructions, or `metadata` fields.
- Operational metadata: ledgers and logs store request identifiers (e.g., `user`, `requestId`, model id) for billing, support, and audit.
- Prompts & outputs: your app controls what content is sent to providers; treat prompt data as potentially sensitive.
- Encryption in transit: all APIs require HTTPS (TLS 1.2+).

See [Privacy](/privacy) for full privacy policy and data subject rights.

## Payments & PCI scope

- Default mode: you collect funds into app‑scoped balances via your own rails (e.g., Stripe). Card data remains within Stripe flows; Paywalls does not handle raw card numbers.
- Shared mode: Paywalls hosts top‑ups; checkout and card handling occur with our payment providers. Your earnings accrue on usage and are available for withdrawal per policy.
- Taxes/invoicing: your app remains responsible for its own ToS, privacy, and tax obligations to end users.

- [Test keys & environments](/more/test-keys-and-environments)

## Network & transport security

- All API endpoints are served over HTTPS; reject plain HTTP.

## Data retention & deletion

- We never store prompt or output contents; only request metadata (e.g., usage data, model/version, timestamps, pseudonymous `user`/request identifiers) is retained.
- Ledger entries are retained for billing and audit purposes.
- Operational logs are retained for troubleshooting and reliability.
- Configurable retention and regional data hosting are on the roadmap. Contact us for current defaults and options.
- For data deletion requests, contact support with relevant identifiers (`user`, ledger ids, request ids) to assist.

## Compliance posture

- We design systems and processes to support common regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR/CCPA principles of data minimization, access, and deletion on request).
- Data Processing Addendum (DPA) and subprocessors list are available on request.
- Formal certifications (e.g., SOC 2) are on the roadmap; reach out for current status.

## Vulnerability & incident response

- Responsible disclosure: report potential vulnerabilities to legal@paywalls.ai. Provide details and reproduction steps.
- We assess, prioritize, and remediate security issues based on severity.
- In the event of a security incident affecting your data, we will notify impacted customers consistent with legal and contractual obligations.

## Backups & disaster recovery

- Regular backups of critical data with encrypted storage.
- Service restoration and continuity procedures are maintained;

## Your responsibilities

- Keep secrets server‑side; never expose paywall, stripe or provider keys to browsers or untrusted clients.
- Send a `user` with every billable request; avoid PII where possible.
- Verify webhooks, log request identifiers, and make side‑effects idempotent.
- Follow your local laws and platform policies (privacy, taxes, consumer protection).
