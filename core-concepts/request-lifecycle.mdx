<Steps>

<Step title="Request">
  Your app calls the OpenAI‑compatible endpoint with a **paywall key** and a
  user id.
</Step>

<Step title="Decision">
  The platform evaluates **authorization** (Shared), **balance**, **limits**,
  and **pricing** rules.
</Step>

<Step title="If action is needed">
  The response is a normal **assistant message** containing an **authorization**
  or **checkout** link. You render it as‑is; no special branching.
</Step>

<Step title="Execution">
  If authorized & funded, the request is forwarded to the configured
  **provider** (BYOK or built‑in). Streaming is passed through.
</Step>

<Step title="Meter & bill">
  — Token usage is measured; the applicable pricing rule computes the charge. A
  **charge** entry is written to the **ledger**.
</Step>

</Steps>
