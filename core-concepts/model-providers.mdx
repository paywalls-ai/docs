  <Tab title="Shared mode">

    	- **BYOK (bring your own key)** — Connect providers you already use (OpenAI, Together, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI‑compatible endpoint). You pay your provider. Paywalls bills your users.

    	- **Built‑in provider** — Use the built‑in provider (powered by OpenRouter) without adding keys. The end user’s shared wallet covers provider cost; Paywalls splits the charge to preserve your margin.

### Model selection & routing

- You choose a model id (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `openrouter/llama-3.1-70b`). We normalize requests and route to the right upstream.
- You can mix providers across requests while keeping one pricing surface.
- Fallbacks and failover depend on provider capabilities.
