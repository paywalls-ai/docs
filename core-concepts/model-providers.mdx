title: "Model providers"

Two integration styles:

- **BYOK (bring your own key)** — Connect providers you already use (OpenAI, Together, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI‑compatible endpoint). **Required for Default mode.** You pay your provider; Paywalls bills your users.
- **Built‑in provider (Shared mode)** — Use the built‑in provider (powered by OpenRouter) without adding keys. The end user’s shared wallet covers provider cost; Paywalls splits the charge to preserve your margin. _(Roadmap: allow built‑in provider with Default mode; developer pays provider separately.)_

### Model selection & routing

- You choose a model id (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `openrouter/llama-3.1-70b`). We normalize requests and route to the right upstream.
- You can mix providers across requests while keeping one pricing surface.
- _(Optional)_ Fallbacks and failover depend on provider capabilities. **TODO:** Document policies per provider.

See the separate **API Reference (Models)** for listing and selecting models.
