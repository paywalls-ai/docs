title: "Pricing & Metering"
---

Pricing is **rule‑based** and **model‑aware** so you can balance UX and margins.

### Pricing layers

- **Per request** — a flat fee per API call (good for tools/actions and short prompts).
- **Per token** — meter **prompt** + **completion** tokens (finalized after generation).
- **Hybrid** — combine both (e.g., _minimum fee + per‑token_) to keep margins predictable.
- **Promos/credits** — trial credits to reduce onboarding friction. _(TODO: expiry & abuse protection in dashboard.)_

### Per‑model dynamic pricing

Set different rates per model so users can self‑select price/performance. Hybrid typically provides the most stable margin across varied prompt sizes.

### Metering details

- Token usage is computed per request. When streaming, totals are **finalized at end** of the stream.
- Rounding: charges round to the smallest supported unit for the configured currency after computation.
- Manual charges (e.g., per‑tool fees) can be combined with usage charges in the same ledger period.
