description: "Paywalls.ai is a no-code, real-time proxy that sits between AI assistants and inference providers.  It meters usage, applies dynamic pricing, and handles payments—so developers can monetize any model, anywhere, with guaranteed margins."

By routing prompts through the [Paywalls.ai](http://Paywalls.ai) proxy instead of sending them directly to an inference provider, you can add **automatic pricing rules, “paywalls,” and user charges** without writing complex billing code.

## How It Works

1. **Proxy the request**\
   You swap your LLM API base URL and key for Paywalls.ai’s:

   ```python
   client.api_base = "https://api.paywalls.ai/v1"
   client.api_key = "sk-paywalls-xxxxxxxx"
   ```

   The proxy receives the prompt instead of the inference provider.
2. **Identify and authorize the user**\
    The proxy identifies (and, if needed, authenticates) the user.\
    It then requests a charge authorization—similar to a credit-card pre-authorization.
3. **Handle failed authorizations**\
    If the user’s balance is low or they are not connected:
   - Show a paywall message, or
   - Launch an AI-powered paywall agent that helps them top up via **your Stripe account** or **Paywalls.ai’s integrated payments**.
4. **Forward the request**\
    If authorization passes, the proxy forwards the prompt to the chosen inference provider.
5. **Bill in real time**\
    When the response returns:
   - The proxy relays it instantly to your assistant/user (no added latency).
   - In parallel, Paywalls.ai calculates the cost (based on provider, model, and tokens), applies your pricing rules, and records the charge.

## Why a Proxy-Based Approach?

- **Dynamic model switching** – Let users choose models at runtime while keeping every request profitable.
- **Real-time cost control** – Prices calculated on the fly, not guessed in advance.
- **Platform agnostic** – Works with any model, provider, or deployment platform.
