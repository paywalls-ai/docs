It’s not just another billing tool—it’s purpose‑built for AI apps, agents, and automations. Today it provides an OpenAI‑compatible chat completions proxy with real‑time metering, dynamic pricing, billing and payment integrations; next, it’s expanding to images, audio, video, embeddings, MCP tools, agent‑to‑agent payments and more.

**Build AI products, not a billing system.** You focus on your product; we handle the hard parts of **pricing, metering, and getting paid**.

### What you get (at a glance)

- **Monetization in minutes, not months** — launch with a working checkout, and usage metering instead of building billing, reconciliation, and reporting from scratch.
- **Dynamic, AI‑native pricing** — price per request, per token, or hybrid; set different rates per model or feature; run promos or free/trial credits without code changes.
- **Instant paywalls** — block unpaid usage and surface prebuilt **authorize/top‑up** experiences exactly when needed so you stop leaking value.
- **Wallets that fit your go‑to‑market** — pick **Default (app‑scoped)** balances for a tightly controlled UX or **Shared (cross‑app)** balances when you want users to top up once and spend across apps.
- **Provider‑agnostic control** — standardize pricing across OpenAI/Anthropic/other providers and keep margins stable even as model menus and rates evolve.
- **A real ledger** — every top‑up and charge is recorded for exports, audits, and analytics.

### Why this matters

- **AI usage is spiky and granular.** Prices differ by model, input/output tokens, and even capability tiers. Rolling your own metering and price logic is slow, brittle, and distracts from shipping features. Paywalls.ai gives you a **purpose‑built, usage‑based foundation** that matches how AI is actually billed.
- **Pricing changes often.** You’ll want to experiment (e.g., minimum fee + per‑token, per‑tool charges, trials, bundles). With Paywalls.ai, you can **iterate pricing without refactoring** your app.
- **Cash flow and guardrails.** Built‑in balance checks and spend controls stop runaway costs, while a clear ledger makes finance and support easier.

### Common outcomes for builders

- **Launch paid v1 fast:** gate AI usage behind a paywall and start charging in minutes — no custom billing stack.
- **Freemium that converts:** give, for example, **100 free messages** or **\$5 in trial credits**, then automatically prompt for top‑ups or route to a subscription.
- **Predictable margins:** enforce a **minimum fee** plus **per‑token** pricing per model; change rates centrally without code changes.
- **Per‑model dynamic pricing:** let users pick a model and automatically apply the right rate while protecting margins across providers.
- **Scale from no‑code to prod:** start with no‑code tools like Zapier/n8n; graduate to Node/Python/Edge using the same paywall settings.

### What Paywalls.ai replaces

- **Metering hacks:** ad‑hoc token counters, cron jobs, and spreadsheet‑driven charge calculations.
- **Patchwork payments:** one‑off Stripe calls/webhooks scattered across services; manual reconciliation.
- **DIY ledgers:** custom tables/scripts for balances, top‑ups, refunds, and disputes.
- **Inconsistent paywalls:** scattered “pay now” modals and error messages that don’t reflect real balance/authorization state.

### What stays yours

- Your product experience, data flows, and model choices.
- Your pricing strategy — Paywalls.ai makes it easy to implement and change.
