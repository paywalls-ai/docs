[Paywalls.ai](http://Paywalls.ai) allows developers to rapidly implement automatic pricing rules, “paywalls,” and user charges by simply routing prompts through the [Paywalls.ai](http://Paywalls.ai) proxy instead of sending them directly to the chosen inference provider. 

When a prompt reaches the proxy, it identifies (and, if needed, authenticates) the user and requests a charge authorization, much like a credit-card pre-authorization. 

- If authorization fails, the user receives a “paywall,” which can either be a static message or an interaction with an AI-powered custom-built agent designed to guide or assist them in topping up. This top-up can be done through the developer’s Stripe account (or other payment gateways) or [Paywalls.ai](http://Paywalls.ai)’s integrated payment features. 
- If authorization passes, the prompt is forwarded to the inference provider defined by the developer in the logic of the assistant. 

When the response returns, the proxy relays it immediately to the assistant and end user without delay. In parallel, [Paywalls.ai](http://Paywalls.ai) determines the cost of that prompt and its response based on the inference provider, model, and tokens used, applies the developer’s pricing rules, and records the charges in the billing system—all in real time.

The advantage of this proxy-based approach is that developers can let users choose and switch models at runtime, with costs calculated on the fly and pricing rules ensuring every request is profitable.
