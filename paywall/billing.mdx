### Overview

[Paywalls.ai](http://Paywalls.ai) supports multiple billing strategies, which you can combine or configure independently per model or paywall.

### Available Strategies

#### 1. Per-Request Fee

Charge a flat fee for every request, regardless of token usage.

#### 2. Per-Token Billing

Charge based on the number of tokens:

- **Prompt tokens** (input)
- **Completion tokens** (model response)

Measured automatically by the proxy or estimated if needed.

#### 3. Manual Charges

Use the `/user/charge` endpoint to deduct custom amounts for features or workflows outside of chat completions.

#### 4. Subscriptions (optional)

You can implement your own subscription system and call [Paywalls.ai](http://Paywalls.ai) only for validation. Coming soon.
