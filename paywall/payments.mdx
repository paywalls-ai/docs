### Overview

[Paywalls.ai](http://Paywalls.ai) uses a prepaid wallet model to control and monetize access to LLM APIs. Before a user can interact with your app through the proxy, they must:

1. **Connect to the paywall** — granting permission to be charged.
2. **Top up their balance** — by purchasing credits in their AI Wallet.

### Connecting to the Paywall

Users must explicitly approve billing before any charges are applied. This is handled through a **connect flow**:

- If the user is not connected, they’ll receive a response containing a `url` to the connection page.
- Once connected, their ID will be associated with your paywall and you can begin charging them.
- You can optionally trigger the flow by calling the `/user/connect` endpoint.

### Topping Up Balance

If a user’s balance is insufficient, the API will return a response containing a **top-up link** (via the `/chat/completions` or `/user/balance` endpoints):

- The top-up process opens a hosted checkout page where users can purchase credit.
- Credits are deposited directly into the user's **AI Wallet**.
- Once topped up, the proxy will allow usage to resume without interruptions.
